Dataset : TITANIC DATASET FROM KAGGLE
Here I had performed the "Exploratory Data Analysis" fo titinic dataset to get the useful insights.
About Dataset :
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for machine learning and data analysis projects. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, passenger class, and whether they survived or not.

Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's sex
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Results
The EDA will provide insights into the Titanic dataset, including the distribution of passengers, survival rates, and relationships between variables. These insights can help in further analysis and modeling tasks.
